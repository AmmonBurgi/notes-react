# State Management
Application state management is the process of maintaining knowledge of an application's inputs across multiple related data flows that form a complete business transaction -- or a session -- to understand the condition of the app at any given moment. In computer science, an input is information put into the program by the user and state refers to the condition of the application according to its stored inputs -- saved as variables or constants. State can also be described as the collection of preserved information that forms a complete session.

## Context
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Helps avoid "prop drilling".

## Redux
